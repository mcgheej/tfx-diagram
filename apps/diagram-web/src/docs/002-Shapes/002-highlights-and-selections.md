# Highlights and Selections

## Highlighting Shapes

As the user moves the mouse cursor over the page it passes over shapes drawn on the page. When a shape is under the current mouse position the application will highlight the shape by drawing highlight handles around the shape. The number, position, and style of the highlight handles is dependent on the shape highlighted. When the cursor is over the page background then no shape is highlighted. This means that at any particular time there will be zero or one shape highlighted.

## Single Selections

A shape can be selected by the user simply clicking the left mouse button when the shape is highlighted. The selection actually occurs when the left mouse button is pushed down. The user may then simply release the button to display a control frame around the selected shape. The control frame comprises a number of control handles and guide outlines. The number, position and style of the control handles is dependent on the shape selected.

The user can now interact with the selected shape in a number of ways. The user can delete the selected shape by pressing the keyboard delete or backspace keys. The user can move the shape on the page by simply dragging the shape with the mouse. The user can change the shape's size / topology by moving the shape's control handles. Finally the user can change other properties, such as colour, line width etc, through the application's user interface.

When a shape is selected its highlight frame will not be displayed. When a selected shape is being moved a simplified control frame is displayed.
