# Endpoints

In TfxDiagram all connector shapes (Line and Curve) have two ends, a _start_ and a _finish_. An _endpoint_ is a simple shape that can be added to a connector end to provide more meaning to the diagram. For example an arrow can be added to the end of a line to indicate directionality, or in a UML class diagram a hollow arrow at the end of a line can show an inheritance relationship.
